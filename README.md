# 🏦 Vaultline — Banking Support Chatbot

A clean, instant-answer support chatbot for common banking queries — account access, cards, UPI, loans, and KYC — built with **Streamlit** and styled with a custom dark "ledger" theme.

> Ask a question in plain English (or Hinglish), get an instant matched answer from a knowledge base — no API keys, no LLM calls, fully offline and self-contained.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Fuzzy question matching** — understands rephrased or loosely-worded questions using Python's built-in `difflib`
- 🎨 **Custom designed UI** — navy & gold "ledger" theme, not the default Streamlit look
- 📝 **Live activity log** — every query you ask is logged with a timestamp, like a passbook entry
- ⚡ **One-click example queries** — common questions are clickable chips for instant answers
- 🧩 **Easily extensible** — add new Q&A pairs by editing a single CSV file, no code changes needed
- 🚫 **No external API / no internet required** — runs 100% locally

## 📝 Adding New Questions

The chatbot's knowledge base is just a CSV file with two columns: `question` and `response`.

```csv
question,response
How do I report a fraud transaction?,"Call our 24x7 fraud helpline immediately and freeze your card via the app under 'Card Services' > 'Block Card'."
```

Add a new row to `banking_support.csv`, save, and the chatbot will pick it up on the next run — no code changes required.
